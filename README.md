# VLC Transceiver System (B.Tech Project)

This repository contains the design and implementation of an LDPC-coded Visible Light Communication (VLC) transceiver system, developed as part of my B.Tech Project at IIT Jodhpur using the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform.

## **Abstract**

This project presents the development of a forward error correction-based transceiver system for audio and text transmission using Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes. The system is built on the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA and demonstrates the integration of multiple signal processing components, including:

- LDPC Encoder and Decoder  
- Finite State Machine (FSM) for control logic  
- Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) for audio signal transmission  
- Python-based simulations to evaluate bit error rates and correction capability  

The system supports both direct electrical and optical communication channels. Experimental validation shows successful real-time signal transmission in both modes. Challenges such as signal attenuation and distortion in the optical channel were identified, pointing to areas for further optimization.
